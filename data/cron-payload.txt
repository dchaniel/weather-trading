Daily weather trading workflow (run at 6am ET / 11:00 UTC):

1. Collect IV snapshot:
   node bin/wt.js collect-iv --silent

2. Generate guard-checked recommendations:
   node bin/wt.js recommend --save

3. Run daily briefing:
   node bin/wt.js daily

4. Track performance:
   node bin/wt.js track

This should be set up as a cron job or OpenClaw scheduled task.
The --save flag on recommend writes to data/pending.json for review.
All recommendations pass through lib/core/guard.js before being shown.
Only trades that pass ALL guards (station whitelist, IV check, spread check,
1 trade/day limit, position size cap, clim outlier check) are recommended.
