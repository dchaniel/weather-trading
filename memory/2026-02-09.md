# 2026-02-09 — Major Development Day

## Multi-Agent Review Loop (11 rounds)
- Built and iterated `kalshi` CLI through 11 rounds of multi-agent review
- 4 agents: Coding, Research (rigor), Product (UX), Simplicity (pruning)
- Score progression:
  - Research: 42→52→54→62→73→67↓→89→92→94→96
  - Product: 38→58→72→78→82→88→91→93→77↓→93→94
  - Simplicity: 27→36→75
- Daniel's rule: **95 MEANS 95.** Don't round up or declare victory early.
- Currently pushing for actual 95 on auto-trade/crypto features (Research 94, Product 92)

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Rebranded**: `wt` → `kalshi` CLI (multi-strategy Kalshi platform, not just weather)
- **KMDW excluded**: Actual MAE=2.56°F vs assumed 0.75°F — 3.4x calibration error, no edge
- **Validated stations**: KNYC (σ=0.85°F), KMIA (σ=0.77°F), KDEN (σ=0.9°F)
- **Command consolidation**: 17 → 9 commands with subcommands (trade/data/perf hubs)
- **Auto paper trading enabled**: `recommend --execute` runs on cron every 4hrs
- **History pipeline**: JSONL files for forecasts, observations, markets, decisions, trades (schema v1)

## Cron Jobs Updated
- `trading-scan`: Now uses `kalshi.js` (was `wt.js`), runs `recommend --execute` + `data snapshot`
- `trading-daily-review`: Updated to `kalshi.js`, runs settle/ledger/risk/calibrate/collect

## Linear Status
- DAN-135 (crypto strategy fix): Done
- DAN-127 (paper trading): In Progress, auto-trading live, balance $953.50
- DAN-132 (low temp markets): Todo
- DAN-131 (more stations): Todo  
- DAN-133 (intraday forecasts): Todo

## Daniel Preferences Learned
- Wants multi-strategy (not weather-only) — "just Kalshi"
- Added simplicity agent at his request — "fourth agent that reduces bloat"
- Wants multi-agent strategy documented as DEFAULT for future sessions → CODING-STRATEGY.md
- **Does not accept "close enough"** — 95 means 95, period
- Goes to bed ~6:45 UTC, wakes ~15:30 UTC (PST timezone)

## Gmail Cron
- Morning email briefing cron failing — `gog` needs OAuth: `gog auth add danielmchan1@gmail.com --services gmail`
- Daniel hasn't set this up yet
